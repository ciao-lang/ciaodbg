# Some Debugging, Testing, and Profiling utilities for Ciao

This bundle groups a number of utilities that are useful for
debugging, testing, profiling, tracing, benchmarking, etc. Ciao
programs.

As other components in Ciao (like the documentation generator and the
static analyzer), some of the components of this bundle make use of
program assertions to obtain the specification of desired behaviors.

Some components of this bundle (e.g., the unit tests) are integrated
into the Emacs-based development environment (under the `CiaoDbg`
menu), and others in the Ciao builder (`ciao test` command). See the
reference manual for more information.
